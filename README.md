# Logistric regression from scratch
I implemented logistic regression from scratch. To train parameters W and b of Logistic regression model, I used cross entropy loss. I also impemented gradient descent as optimization method. Note that with cross entropy loss we have a convex optimization problem. Thus, GD gaurantees to converge to the optimal solution.

I applied my model to TITANIC dataset and mnist dataset. In mnist I used my model to classify images of 1 and 7.
